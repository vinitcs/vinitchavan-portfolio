      "As a Node.js backend developer, I played a key role in designing, developing and optimizing the backend infrastructure for a mobile application. My responsibilities included architecting and maintaining RESTful APIs with efficient query handling and caching for high scalability. I managed the clientâ€™s both development and production servers, handling deployments, monitoring logs, and ensuring zero downtime during version updates. I integrated payment checkout mechanisms using third-party gateways and implemented webhook listeners for automated transaction confirmations. Additionally, I developed a cloud media storage pipeline to store user-uploaded media files with category-based organization, enhancing searchability and data management efficiency. This contributed to a more reliable, maintainable, and performance-oriented backend.",
